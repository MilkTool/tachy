
This example solution includes a file "InitTachy.ss"

A standard version of this file will be loaded behind the scenes if 
it is not included in your solution.

If you want a different version, or if you want to debug it, simply add the InitTachy.ss to your solution.

When you start debugging your application, it will start debugging InitTachy.ss first.
